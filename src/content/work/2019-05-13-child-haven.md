## Brief

Child Haven came to me wanting to improve their online presence. 
They wanted their own site to act not only as a platform for people to book their services, but also to convince users to become customers. 

The site needed to reflect their brand, which had already been created, as well as catering directly to their target audience, parents.

## Target Audience

Child Haven and I defined the target audience as parents of a wide range of ages, who are busy, not necessarily web savvy, and since their business is in Vietnam they would most likely be viewing the website on a mobile device, which are ubiquitous, as opposed to laptops. 

This meant that mobile development took presendence, as well as ensuring the user could quickly understand how to make a booking in as few steps as possible.
