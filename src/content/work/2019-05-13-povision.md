## The Brief

Built in colloboration with a group of film students - they came to me with the concept of a web app that gave the user the ability to view an Ice Hockey match from any players perspective.

Built using React, a framework that prior to this project (Early 2019) I had no experience using. This was my chance to learn, I went from zero technical understanding of React to deployment of POVision in < 2 weeks. Since then my ability with React has only increased having built multiple complex projects, including zyppd.in, Folktiles, and this website that was built using Gatsby.
