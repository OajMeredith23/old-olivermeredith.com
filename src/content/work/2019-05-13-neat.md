<div class="text span-width">
      <h2>Brief</h2>
      <p>
        Create a prototype app design that addresses the issue of mental health amongst NEATs' (those not in employment education or training) aged between 18 - 25.
      </p>
</div>

<div class="text">
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>
        The aim of the project wasn't to start with an idea and research it. It was to understand that market and create something specifically suited for them.
      </p>
    <p> 
        The first step towards this was research, I conducted both interviews and surveys to get an understanding of the target markets feelings on their mental wellbeing. 
    </p>
</div>

    <h2>User Personas</h2>
    <p>
      Creating three user personas that related to my earlier 
      research helped to humanise the project, giving me specific characters to design for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each persona is designed to both fit the target audience and be representative of what I discovered through my research.
    </p>
</div>

    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>
      Fast, iterative design sketchnotes helped to produce ideas quickly. For many of these it would be immediately clear they wouldn't work, but others held potential.
    </p>
    <p>
      After filtering out the bad ideas, I put the remainders out for feedback from my target audience which lead me to the concept of an app that helps you to decide what career path you could be interested in, and then connects you with professionals related to that field.
    </p>

    <h2>The User Journey</h2>
    <p>
      Although most people agreed that the concept of the app was good, It also could be quite dry, and particularly for the target audience, uninteresting.
    </p>
    <p>
      To remedy this I deciding on gamifying the career finder. The user would discover an array of options suited to them by the results returned at the end of the game. 
      <br>
      To understand how this could work I created a model of the user journey. Continiously iterating and receiving feedback until the journey felt effortless.
    </p>

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>
      With the app conceptually complete the process of building the final high fidelity prototype could begin. 
      <br>
      The first stage in this was to create simple wireframes, the user interface design would come later, at this point I was still focusing on ensuring the app was functionally sound. 
      <br> 
      By doing this I was able to iterate over my ideas and test them very quickly and if any changes were needed they could be done much faster than if the interface design had already begun.
    </p>

<div class="text">
    <h2>Branding</h2>
    <!-- <p>
      The main goal of NEAT is to help it's target audience get started along a career path that suits them perfectly. Somewhat like a career finding platform, but I felt from the beginning that the branding shouldn't take a similar aesthetic to competing apps. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead I wanted the branding to focus on motivation & aspiration. The colours, fonts and icons are directly inspired by sports marketing
    </p> -->
    <p>
      The branding of NEAT is directly inspired by the sports industry â€” bright colours and strong typefaces as opposed to the more professional aesthetic of other career finding apps.
